# airplane-fighter

The user must control an airplane fighter in order to avoid or destroy enemy objects (meteorites).

• The user can choose an airplane model before the game starts.

• Move the airplane model by moving your mouse in order to avoid obstacles.

• You can destroy the obstacles by pressing "right-click" on the mouse.  
(If you use a trackpad, move your finger on the trackpad for movement and use taps on it for shooting bullets.)

• Each destroyed meteorite will increase your score points.

Have Fun!
